# Driver Overhead Benchmark [3DPROG3 PROJECT]
Our project in DV2551

Members: Karl Hansson, Filip Pentik√§inen, Peyman Torabi

The aim of our project is to measure the driver overhead in Vulkan, 
as compared with OpenGL to determine
how significant the difference may be during different stages of the program
(initialization, execution, clean up, etc...). Since Vulkan claims
to be low-overhead, we would expect to see that reflected in the data, assuming
our tests are accurately representing reality. 

We'd also hope to be able to draw
some conclusions around what parts of the program that the different APIs
have the most overhead. Since one of the strengths of Vulkan is that you have
greater control over the creation of pipelines, we would expect the initialization part to
take longer than the other APIs depending on how they choose to defer pipeline
creation, while execution might be lower overhead for Vulkan. You may call this
part of our _hypothesis_.

We aim to do this by essentially implementing the same program multiple times as
static libraries, one for each API, which can be executed from a single benchmark
executable that collects our desired metrics. Our main metric is time, but the
possibility to measure memory overhead also exists.

Since we want to measure driver overhead we want to try to have as much interaction
with the driver as possible. How we'll do this is still uncertain, but our initial
idea is to run a compute shader in each API that also requires memory
transfers between GPU and CPU to increase the amount of communication that needs
to be done and synchronized. One such task could be Gaussian Elimination where
forward-substitution is done on the GPU and backward-substitution on the CPU. It
should also be a trivial task to make identical shader code across the APIs
for a task such as this.

# Test structure
* **Initialization**
  * **Window Creation**
    * Both API's will be using the same window library (glfw). OpenGL context creation is mostly done by the help of this library, meanwhile most Vulkan initialization is done by hand.
  * **Resource Creation** 
    * Create _2N_ shader modules with slightly differing source to avoid caching.
    * Create _N_ Pipelines with the help of the previous shader modules.
  * **Drawing**
    * (In each test we have the ability to split the work into multiple threads on Vulkan).
    * _"First Draw Test"_. Draw one triangle per pipeline (_N_ triangles). We expect the time we use a pipeline to be extra expensive due to the OpenGL deferring pipeline compilation, so we want a this to be a special data-point. 
    * _"Second Draw Test"_. Draw _M_ triangles per pipeline (_N \cdot M_ triangles). Bind pipelines optimally.
    * _"Third Draw Test"_. Draw _M_ triangles per pipeline (_N \cdot M_ triangles). Bind pipelines non-optimally.
  * **Clean Up**
    * No real thorough tests here. Mostly just time the shutdown I suppose.

# Instructions

Compilation instructions using CMake

## Prerequisites

* <img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logos/logomark-orange@2x.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="16" height="16" border="10" /> git
* <img src="https://www.macupdate.com/images/icons256/49301.png" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="16" height="16" border="10" /> CMake 3.8.2 (or higher)
* A c++ compiler with c++14 compatability

## Compilation on Linux

* After cloning the repo, navigate into the created folder.
* Make a new folder named 'build'.
* Navigate into the build folder.
* From the terminal, execute the command `cmake ..` to execute cmake
* To compile, run `make`.
* The executable is found in `build/benchmark/src/` (relative to repo root) and should be named `benchmark`.

## Compilation on Windows (using Visual Studio 2017)

Visual Studio 2017 comes with integrated CMake support which should make this process
fairly simple.

Please note that you must enable `Visual C++ tools for CMake` in the Visual Studio
installer for the integrated support!

* After cloning the repo, open Visual Studio and instead of opening a project, select Open Folder, and navigate to the newly cloned repo.
* You are now using VS2017 in a CMake environment. Some settings will have changed from what you may be used to. You should still be able to compile and run as usual. The runnable/debugable target should be called `benchmark`.

## Compilation on Windows (using CMake-GUI)

If you are using an earlier version of Visual Studio or something completely different,
you can use cmake-gui to generate a visual studio project instead.

It is recommended that you use the previous approach if at all possible.

* After cloning the repo, open cmake-gui and pick it as the "source directory".
* Create a folder named 'build' in the reposotiry root folder and select it as the "build destination".
* Click the 'Configure' button and choose the build system you want to use.
* Click generate.
* Once finished, if you chose visual studio you will now have a Visual Studio Solution and a number of projects available to you in the build folder. To compile and debug you simply open the solution file in visual studio and work as per usual.
* NOTE: AVOID changing settings directly in the solution or project files if they can instead be added into the CMake configurations.
